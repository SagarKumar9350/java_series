Reflection in java:
    use to examine the classes,methods,fields,interfaces at runtime and possible to change the behaviour of the class too
    for example:
        present methods
        present fields
        return type of the methods
        modifier of the class
        what all interfaces class has implemented
        change the value of public and private fields etc..


Issues:
    it breaks the concept of singleton class,by creating instance by setting the accessiblility of constructor "true".
    Reflection is slow
    so it is discouraged to use
