Generic Class:(important) refer the notes
    if we create class Print and uses the parent class of all (Object) to hold values it will create the confusion of datatype
    to prevent this we use generic class using " class Print<T> " where <T> can be any non-primitive object
    we can use more than one parameter also: Print<K,V>
    we can also create generic method:
        type parameter should be before the return type of method declaration
        type parameter scope is limited to method only
    Raw type:
        it's a name of the generic class or interface without any type argument
        we can instantiate the object as concrete class object creation, it will take "Object" as the type and can accept any type
    Bounded generics:
        it can be used at genetic class and method
        upperbound: <T extends Number> // now we can pass Number and its child , we have bound the upper limited
        multibound: <T extends superclass & interface1 & interface2> // first restrictive type should be concrete class, can use multiple interfaces
    Wildcard: it is used because in case of parameter of list we can't hold childobject list in parentreference of list
        upperbound: <? extends UpperBoundClassName> // class name and below
        lowerbound: <? super LowerBoundClassName> //class name and above
        unbounded: it can only read
    type erasers: when code is converted in byte code then all generic will be converted like T -> Object,etc..
