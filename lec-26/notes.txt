LinkedHashMap:
    helps in maintains insertion order
    helps in maintain access order -> frequently used from less to high
    similar to HashMap,but also uses Double LinkedList

now we have fields:
    hash,key,value,next -> previously also present in HashMap
    before,after -> newly added
    next -> is for the next element in the bucket
    before,after -> is used for the ordering of the values inserted, like doubly LinkedList

accessorder: true -> for the frequency of usage from less to high

It can be used for caching: because of frequency concept

Time complexity: 
    average O(1)
    worst: O(n) or O(logn)

Is is not thread safe


TreeMap:
    sorted according to the natural ordering of the key, or by comparator provided
    it uses Red-black tree(self balancing binary search tree)
    O(logn) time complexity
