method:
    used to perform certain task
    it's a collections of instructions that perform some specific task
    used to bring code reusability and readability

declaration: public int sum(int a, int b){}

Access specifier:
    public -> method can be accessed through any class in any package(collection of similar logic/classes  (folder))
    private -> method can be accessed only in the same class
    protected -> can be access by other classes in same package or other sub-classes in different paackage
    default -> it can only be used by classes in same package

Return type: void,int ,etc.

Method name: some kind of action,camel casing

Parameters: it can be empty, or list of variables

Types of Methods:
    system defined method: methods that are already defined and ready to use in java like Math.sqrt()
    user defined method: created by user
    overloaded method: more than one method with same name in same class (it do not consider return type , it only diffentiated based on arguments)
    overridden method: sub class has the same method as parent method (signature should be same)
        parent -> doctor        //inheritance
        parent d = new doctor() //making instance
        d.somemethod()          // it will resolve at run time and check for somemethod() first in doctor class than in parent class.
    static method: (important)
        these are associated with class
        can be called just with class name
        static method can not access non static instance variables and methods
        it cannot be overridden(as overriding is done at run time but static deals with compile time binding)
            if we try to override -> it will hide the method, as method is called with classname.method() so they will call respective methods.
    
    when to declare method static:
        -> methods which do not modify the state of the object can be declared static
        -> utitity method which do not use any instance variable and compute only on arguments

    final method: final method cannot be overridden in java
        as the implementation can't be changed so no use of overriding
    abstract method: only defined in abstract class, only method declaration is done, its implementation is done in child classes
        example: public abstract void print();


variable arguments: when number of arguments is not fixed
    only one variable argument is present in the method
    it should be the last argument in the list
    example: public int sum(int ...variable){
        //we can loop on the variable list
    }
