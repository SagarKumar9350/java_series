Interface features:

1) default method (java8):
    before java8 methods are by default abstract
    if any new methods has been added in the interface all supclasses has to implement that
    To overcome this:
        default methods are introduced: it has implementation , so no need to override it in the subclasses
    why it is introduced in java8:
        to introduced feature in legacy code , so that it doesn't have to be implemented by the previous subclasses
    
default and multiple inheritance:
    if implemented classes again have ambiguity of same common name then implementation has to provided by the child classes

extending default methods:
    ->can be directly passed to child without updating anything
    ->if method became abstract then the next child class has to give implementation
    ->can be overrided in the child class


2) Static mehtod(java8):
    we can provide the implementation of the method in the interface
    bu it cannot be overriden by classes which implement the interface
    we can access it using interface name itself
    its by default public

3) Private methods and private Static methods(java9):
    can provide implementation
    private interface method cannot be abstract,means we have to provide the definition
    it can be used inside of the particular interface only
