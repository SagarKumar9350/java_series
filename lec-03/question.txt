Q) why in java a single file can have only 1 public class?

->Main method inside public class
    as main method is invoked by jvm(it should be accessed by jvm , that's why it is public)

->public class name should be same as file name
    suppose we make multiple public class in a file 
    example: Employee.java

    public class A{

    }
    public class B{

    }
    public class C{

    }
    .....
    Now how will jvm know which class have main method for starting the execution , that's why file name should be equal to public class name 
    and it should be only one

    A.java
    public class A{

    }
    class B{
        
    }
