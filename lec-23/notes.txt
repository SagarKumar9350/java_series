Queue:
    is an interface, child of collection interface,follows FIFO approach
    6 methods -> add()(exception),offer(),poll(),remove()(exception),peek(),element()(exception)
    

priorityqueue:
    min and max
    natural ordering by default -> ascending order(min heap)
    traversal is done -> level wise (not in the order)
    time complexity:
        add,offer,poll & remove head element -> O(logn)
        peak:O(1)
        remove arbitary element: O(n)

Comparator and comparable: helps in sorting
