variable -> container which holds a value
int var = 32;

java is static typed language -> we have to define the datatype before like , int a = 2;
strong typed language -> we can't assign any value, we have a range for datatype

Naming convention for variables
    case sensitive
    unicode letter and digits
    can start with $,_,letter
    cannot be reserved words("class","new","float",etc)
    all small if 1 word otherwise camel casing
    for constant variable name it should be define in capital letters

Types of variables
primitive types: 8 types
    char -> 2 bytes ,ASCII values, range (0 to 65535)
    byte -> range(-128 to 127),default value is 0(default value can only be assigned to class members, for method variables we have to assign values), signed(-ve is allowed) 2nd compliment
    short -> 2 bytes,signed 2nd compliment,range(-32768 to 32767),default value is 0
    int -> 4 bytes,signed 2nd compliment,range (-2^31 to 2^31 - 1),default value is 0
    long -> 8 bytes,signed 2nd compliment,range (-2^63 to 2^63 - 1),default value is 0
    float -> 4 bytes, float a  = 32.20f
    double -> 8 bytes, doble d = 20.08d
    boolean -> 1 bit true/false,default valus is false

type conversion
    widening/automatic conversion -> from small datatype to large datatype
    downcasting/explicit casting -> larger to smaller , we have to typecast like (byte)value
    promotion -> if expression crosses the previous datatype limit , it will promote

Kind of variables:
    local,instance/member variable,method Parameters,constructor Parameters
