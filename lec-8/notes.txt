Constructor:
    use to create an instance and initialize the instance variable
    -->then what does "new" used if constructor is for insitializing the instance -> "new" is used to tell compiler to call constructor 
    similat to method except:
        name:same as class name
        return type:Constructor doesn't have return type




important questions:

why constructor name is same as class name, and it doesn't have return type?
    to identify that it is a constructor also  it has implicit return type of class 

why constructor cannot be final ?
    person -> student
    here in this case person constructor will be person() without return type now suppose if student also inherit the constructor -> it will have person()
    constructor but it will break the role to have same name for student class so it will also expect a return type like a regular method as a result 
    constructor can't be overrided
    and final is used to prevent overriding also so that condition is already achieved in constructor so no need to use final

why constructor cannot be abstracted?
    as abstract method implementation is done in inherited class but constructor can't be inherited

why constructor cannot be static?
    ->because constructor is used to initialize the instance variables also , if we make it static then how will it access non-static variables
    ->we can't able to use super

why constructor cannot be defined in interface?
    because we can't create object of interface then no use of constructor


Notes:

->init block is used even before constructor as it is used for setup purposes

->constructor cannot be inherited
->default constructor is provided by java, until we haven't defined any constructor -> if we defined any constructor we have to define default constructor
->no argument constructor similar to default but user defined
->parameterized constructor
->overloading in constructor is also done but it cannot override
->private costructor: we cannot create object outside of that class, so we have to make another static method ( in the class to call constructor and 
    return object through it) that is used in another class to create object directly using class name(because of static method)
->constructor chaining:
    this: points to the constructor according to the parameters, like-> this(val1,val2), works in same class only
    super: constructor will be called from parent->child for this if we create child instance directly child constructor will first call super() 
        to call parent constructor.
