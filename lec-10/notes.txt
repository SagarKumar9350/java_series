Concrete class:
    can create instance using new keyword
    all method in this have implementation
    it can also be child class from interface or extends abstract class
    class modifier can be "public" or "package private" 

Abstract class(0 to 100%):
    hide internal features and show important implementation only
    can have concrete as well as abstract method
    cannot create object of this class

Super and Sub class:
    in case of absence of super class, Object is the parent of all class
    example: Object obj1 = new Person(1); // parent reference holding object of child class

Nested class:
    2 types: static , non static/inner class
    class within a class is called nested class
    if a class A is only used by single class B then we can create A inside be
    also help to group logically related classes in one file
    scope is same as the outer class
    can be created as a public,private,protected,default
    inheritance can also be done in nested class:
        if static nested class is inherited: extends OuterClass.NestedClass
        if inner class is inherited: extends OuterClass.InnerClass // but we have to create Object of outer class and call super() on it in the constructor of child class

    static nested class:
    non-static nested class/inner class:
        local inner class: defined in any block(method,if,etc...) can only be default,cannot be initiated outside of the block as the scope is inside that block
        member inner class: can be public,private,protected,default
        anonymous inner class: (important)
            innerclass with no name
            when we want to override the behaviour of the method without even creating any subclass
