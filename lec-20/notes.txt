Operators in java:

expression: consist of one or more operand or zero or more Operators

Categories of operators in java:

1)Arithmetic operators
2)Relational operators: compares two operand Relation
    ==,!=,>,<,>=,<=
3)Logical operators: combines 2 or more condition
    && (if first is false it will not compute the other part), || (if first is true then not compute the other)
4)Unary operators: requires only single operand
    ++,--,+(uniray plus),-(unary minus),!(logical not)
5)Assignment operators:
    =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=
6)Bitwise operators: (important)
    &,|,^,~(bitwise not)
    ~ : generally its formula is -(n+1)
        it can be come in unary too
        to get negative bit representation of number : take 2's compliment -> one's compliment then add 1
        example : 5 is 0101 -> 1010 + 1 -> 1011 is equal to (-8+2+1) = -5
7)Bitwise Shift operators: (important)
    <<(signed left shift), >>(signed right shift), >>>(Unsigned right shift), there is no <<<(Unsigned left shift)
8)Ternary operator:
    (condition) ? expression1 : expression2
9)Type comparison operator: for type checking
    instanceof (sometimes also shown under relational operators list) as it returns boolean value
    example: obj instanceof ParentClass
