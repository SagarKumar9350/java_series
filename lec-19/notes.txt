Exception handling:
    event occur during the execution of the program
    it will disrupt your program normal flow
    it creates the Exception object ,which contains information about the Error like:
        type of Exception,message,stack trace(from the point of exeption to the starting point)
    Runtime system use this Exception Object and find the class which can handle it

hirerachy:

Object -> Throwable:
    Error: related to jvm,not in out hand , it is also unchecked
        OutofMemoryError
        StackOverflowError,etc..
    Exception: respect to our code ,in out hand upto certain point
        unchecked/Runtime exception:
            ClassCastException
            ArithmeticException
            IndexOutOfBoundException: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException,StringIndexOutOfBoundException
            NullPointerException
            IllegalArgumentException: NumberFormatException

        checked/compile time exception:
            ClassNotFoundException
            InterruptedException
            IOException: FileNotFoundException,EOFException,SocketException
            SQLException




Runtime Exception:
    occur during runtime and compile not forcing us to handle them

Compile time Exception:
    compiler verifies them during the compile time of the code and if not handled properly,code compilation will fail
    can handle using:
        "throws" // throws used if the method can throw exception , now its caller responsibility to handle it
        "try/catch" //


How to handle the exception: using try,catch,finally,throw,throws,

try: 
    code block which can give exception
    after try either catch block or finally
catch: 
    to catch the exception from try block // catch(ExceptionType e){// handle e}
    can use multiple catch after try block
    catch block is used to catch all exception which can be thrown in the try block
    if parent Exception is used to handle then use it after the specific Exception handling
    one catch block can catch many Exception // catch(ExceptionType|ExceptionType e){}
throw: 
    use to throw any new exception
    to re-throw the exception
throws: 
    used with the method signature
finally:
    always executed even if you return from try block or catch block
    only 1 finally block
    mostly used for closing the object,adding logs,etc
    in case of jvm related issues like,out of memory,system shut down or our process is forcefully killed, then finally 
        block do not get executed


Creating own custom exception:
    using extends exception

Advantage of Exception handling:
    clean our code by seperating the exception handling from regular code
    it allow your progam to recover from Error
    allow to add more information,which support debugging
    improves security by hiding the sensitive data

Disadvantage:
    little expensive,if stack trace is huge and it is not handled or handled at parent class
    try to avoid using exception handling ,if it can be done in other manner(like using if,else condition etc..)
