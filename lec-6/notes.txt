Reference data type

class:
property+functions
"new" keyword used to create object
Example : Employee e = new Employee() -> here e is Reference to the created object in heap 

in java we don't have pointers (&a) so we can deal with pass by value , but to achieve the nature of pass by Reference , we use the objects here
in the above case e has reference to the object.


String:
It is immutable, because if we try to update the value it will create new literal and points towards it, older literal will still be there
String literals: 
    String s1 = "hello";
    String s2 = "hello"; // it will check if a literal "hello" is present or not , if it is already present , then s2 will point to the same s1 in String constant pool
    String s3 = new String("hello") // it will create a new String in heap 


Interface:
    it has only method signature not the implementation, we can't create object for interface
    Person interface -> Teacher and Engineer -> Student


Array:
int [] arr = new int[5];
int arr[] = new int[5];
int arr[] = {30,20,10,22,33};
2 D array ->
int arr[][] = new int[5][5];


Wrapper class:
for each primitive type we have reference type/wrapper
Integer,Character,Short,Byte,Long,Float,Double,Boolean

Advantages:
    ->when we want to reflect changes in the original entity, like reference data type
    ->all java collections works with reference datatype that's why it is useful 

example: 
    int a = 20;
    Integer a1 = a; // primitive to wrapper(autoboxing)

    Integer b = 20;
    int b1 = b; // wrapper class to primitive(unboxing)


Constant variables:
    final keyword is used like : static final int emp_ID = 10; //if we crate  in a class directly as static is used
