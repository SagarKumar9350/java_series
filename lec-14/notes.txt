Interface:
    "interface" keyword used
    only public and default modifier is allowed
    comma separated list of parent interfaces


why we need interface?
->abstraction: we can achieve full abstraction
->polymorphism: interface can be used as a datatype to hold the instance of the child class instance and object is decided at runtime
->multiple inheritance: 

methods in interface:
    all methods are implicit public only
    method cannot be declared as final

fields in interface:
    public,static and final
    cannot make them private and protected

Interface implementation:
    overriding method cannot have more restrict access specifier
    concrete class must override all the methods declared in the Interface
    abstract class is not forced to override all the methods
    class can implement multiple interfaces

Nested interface:
    declared within another interface
    declared within another class
    generally used to group logical related interfaced 

    rules:
        nested interface inside interface must be public
        nested interface inside class can have any access specifier
        when implementing outer interface inner interface implementation is not required and vice versa

difference between abstract class and interface:
    keyword,extends vs implements,methods,
    abstract -> can extends from another class and multiple interfaces , interface -> can only extends from another interfaces
    abstract -> variables as static,non static,final,non final etc,  interface -> variables are by default constants
    abstract -> variables and methods can be private,protected ,public,default,  interface -> variables and methods are by 
        default public(in java9 ,private method is supported)
    abstract->can have constructor, interface -> cannot have constructor
    abstract -> to declare method abstract , we have to use "abstract" keyword and it can be protected,public,default
        interface->no keyword is needed to make mehtod abstract,and by default its public 
    

    Note:
    from java 8 onwards interface can have default,static and private methods too,where we can provide implementation
