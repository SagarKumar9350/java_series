POJO:
    "plain old java object"
    contains variables,getter,setters
    class should be public
    public default constructor
    no annotations should be used like @Table,@Entity,etc
    should not extend any class or implement any interface.
    Advantage:
        it is useful for single source for other classes using this class

ENUM class:
    collection of CONSTANTS (static final)
    cannot extend any class, as it internally extends java.lang.Enum class
    it can implement interfaces
    can have variables,constructor,methods
    cannot be initiated(as its constructor will be private only, even you give default, in bytecode it make it private)
    no other class can extend Enum class
    it can have abstract method, and all the constant should implement that abstract method

    it will always have certain values starting from 0 , if no values has been assigned to it
    methods:
        values(): list of enums
        ordinal(): to get the default values
        valueOf(): match the exact values passed
        name(): names of the constant
    Enum with custom values:
        every constants will get the variables defined in the classes
        if method declared then all constants can use it
    Method override in enum:
        we can override the implementation for particular constants
        example: constant1{ // override the method here}
    enums with abstract method:
        all constants should provide the implementation of the abstract method
    enums with interface:
        when we want to give some functionality to all constants we can implement interface and give implementation,
        so that all can use it just like simple merhod is shared among them
    Advantage of enum over static final variables:
        readability
        control over method

FINAL class:
    final class cannot be inherited
